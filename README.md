# Repair Villager

Add a custom villager to Minecraft that can repair items for a fixed price, bypassing the prior work penalty. This is a data pack, not a mod, so you can include it in any vanilla world.

# How to Use

## Summon the Repair Villager

To summon the repairs villager, place an anvil anywhere and then place a block of emerald on top of it. The block of emerald gets consumed when summoning the villager.

## Repairing items

To repair items, simply toss them to the villager and wait for them to pick the items up. Then trade with the villager and buy back the item. The item will be fully repaired. There's no discount for repairing an item that was only slightly worn, but having a mending enchantment on the item will make the repairs cheaper.

# Multiplayer

This data pack should be compatible with multiplayer worlds, but has only been tested in single-player.

# Adding This Data Pack to Your World

You can download the latest version of the data pack [here](https://github.com/Piper1618/Repair-Villager/releases/latest). The file you want will be named RepairVillager.zip

## Existing Worlds

Have you made a backup of this world? Please make a backup of this world. Minecraft can do it from the world select screen by selecting the world, clicking *Edit* and then *Make Backup*.

You can add the data pack to an already existing world. You'll need to find to your world's folder. If you're not sure where it is, open Minecraft, select *Singleplayer*, select your world, and click *Edit*. Then click *Open World Folder*.

You'll need to place the data pack .zip file in the world's *datapacks* folder. You don't need to extract the .zip file. Once that's done, the data pack should activate automatically the next time you open the world in Minecraft.

If the data pack does not activate automatically. You can activate it manually using the [/datapack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/datapack) command like so: `/datapack enable "file/RepairVillager.zip"`. If you are in a single-player world and don't have permission to use the command, you can temporarily grant yourself permission by pausing the game, selecting *Open to LAN*, switching *Allow Cheats* to ON, and clicking *Start LAN World*.

## New Worlds

On the *Create New World* screen, click the *Data Packs*. You can drag the data pack .zip file onto the Minecraft window or click *Open Pack Folder* to open a temporary folder to copy it into. Once the file is available in Minecraft, you'll need to hover your mouse over the data pack and click the arrow to move it from *Available* to *Selected*.

# Removing the Data Pack

It is safe to remove the data pack at a later time. You can delete the .zip file from your world while the world is not open in Minecraft or disable it in the game using the command, `/datapack disable "file/RepairVillager.zip"`. If you are in a single-player world and don't have permission to use the command, you can temporarily grant yourself permission by pausing the game, selecting *Open to LAN*, switching *Allow Cheats* to ON, and clicking *Start LAN World*.

If you remove the data pack from a world, any repair villagers in that world will no longer be able to repair items, but nothing else will break. The villagers will resume working if the pack is re-added.
